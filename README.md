The custom tracking project is important and effective in the current era, designed primarily to
help in tracking its owner using advanced technologies. The system utilizes a variety of ROS
servers and tools to manage data and integrate different algorithms for owner identification and
tracking. The PyzBar library is used to identify the owner through a QR code, while a particle
filtering algorithm is implemented for the tracking process. The Kinect camera's internal sensors
are employed to maintain the owner's safety, and an ultrasonic sensor is used to detect and
overcome obstacles. Ultimately, the project resulted in a robot capable of tracking the owner based
on a specific QR code, with the ability to navigate around obstacles and maintain a safe distance
between itself and the owner.
